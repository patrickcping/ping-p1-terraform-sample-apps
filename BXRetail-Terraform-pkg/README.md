# Getting Started

Install Terraform on your machine, following the instructions [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

## Configure PingOne for Terraform access

If not done so already, first configure your PingOne organization for Terraform access by following the instructions at the [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#configure-pingone-for-terraform-access).

## Cloning the Project
### Variables
After cloning the project, in a code editor navigate to `/terraform` and create a file named `terraform.tfvars` with the following:

```hcl
region            = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id   = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id      = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id     = "{{adminUserId}}"
license_id        = "{{licenseId}}"
worker_id         = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret     = "{{workerSecret}}"
k8s_deploy_name   = "{{k8sDeployName}}"
k8s_deploy_domain = "{{k8sDeployDomain}}"
k8s_namespace     = "{{k8sNamespace}}"
proxy_image_name  = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-integration-proxy:0.1.0"
app_image_name    = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:202303-0.19.5-beta"
```


| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| region | Region for PingOne Environment | 
| organization_id | PingOne Organization Id - Located under Environment -> Properties, see [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#finding-required-ids) for further instructions. | 
| admin_env_id | PingOne Environment Id for Administrators Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties |
| admin_user_id | User Id for a user in the Administrators Environment - Located under Identities -> Users -> Select user -> Click API tab -> ID |
| license_id | License Id to be used for PingOne Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties, see [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#finding-required-ids) for further instructions.|
| worker_id | Client Id for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select existing Worker App or create one -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client ID |
| worker_secret | Client Secret for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select Worker App -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client Secret |
| k8s_deploy_name | Name used for k8s deployment |
| k8s_deploy_domain | K8s Deploy Domain name |
| k8s_namespace | K8s Namespace to deploy app |

### Deployment

In the command line, navigate to the `/terraform` directory and run:

```zsh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```hcl
terraform apply â€”auto-approve
````

If this is successful, you will see a new environment added to your PingOne organization under the name `Ping Identity Example`. 
If this is successful, you will see a new environment added to your PingOne organization under the name "Ping Identity Example".

**NOTE:** The k8s deployment creates new ingresses and a subdomain for the app of `k8s_deploy_name.k8s_deploy_domain`. So the app may not be immediately available when terraforming is complete. Go get yourself some coff-ay and try again.

### Optional - Custom Docker Images
Ping Identity Technical Enablement hosts and maintains the sample Docker image. However, it is possible to build and host your own Docker images by following the instructions below.

To start, you will need your own Docker image repository to push to and update your `terraform.tfvars` file accordingly. Depending on your image repository, whether that's local, ECR, GCR, etc, you may need to update the `k8s.tf` file too. 

Note: In this current version, we are not using the fastify proxy server image. So recreating that is unnecessary.

**From the command line**, change directories to the `/bxretail-sample-app` directory.

```zsh
cd <your project path>/BXTerraform/BXTerraform-Sample-Apps/BXRetail-Terraform-pkg/bxretail-sample-app
```

Then run: 
```zsh
build -f Dockerfile.dev -t <host>/<repo_path>/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:<version_tag> .
```
