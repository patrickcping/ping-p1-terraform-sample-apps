# BXRetail + Terraform + PingOne Sample App Package

## Source Code Folders
### /bxretail-sample-app/src

| Folder | Contents |
| ------ | -------- |

\* Folders you care about.

### /terraform

| File | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| .terraform | Terraform [working directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/init#working-directory-contents) created by Terraform. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. You won't see this until you run `terraform init`. |
| .terraform.lock.hcl | The Terraform [dependency lock file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock). Where Terraform manages the versions of the downloaded providers or modules. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. If you need to update versions, see [-upgrade option](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock#dependency-installation-behavior). You won't see this until you run `terraform init`. |
| data.tf | HCL for doing [data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) lookups/reads on data in your environment/infrastructure. |
| k8s.tf | HCL for creating [kubernetes](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs) services, ingresses, and deployments. |
| main.tf | HCL for necessary [providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers) and [modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules). |
| outputs.tf | HCL declaring [output values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs) that are the result of dynamic data. In this case, the deployed apps URL. |
| resources.tf | HCL that declares all the [resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources) we need to create in our environment/infrastructure. The things you normally create by clicking around the PingOne admin console manually. |
| terraform.tfstate | The [Terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) file. This is where Terraform manages the "state" of your infrastructure and compares that against your deployed infrastructure. Never touch this. It's managed by Terraform. |
| terraform.tfvars | [Variable definitions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files), name/value pairs, that should not be part of your project repo and added dynamically during Terraform execution. This will not exist until you create it according to the instructions in the project-specific README. |
| vars.tf | HCL that declares [variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables) that will be needed in defining your environment/infrastructure. |
| versions.tf | HCL declaring [required providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers) & versions to use. |


## Cloning the Project
## Configure PingOne for Terraform access

If not done so already, first configure your PingOne organization for Terraform access by following the instructions at the [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#configure-pingone-for-terraform-access).

### Variables
After cloning the project, navigate to `/terraform` and create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the following:

```hcl
region          = "{{ NorthAmerica | Canada | Asia | Europe }}"
organization_id = "{{orgId}}"
admin_env_id    = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id   = "{{adminUserId}}"
license_id    = "{{licenseId}}"
worker_id       = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret   = "{{workerSecret}}"
k8s_deploy_name = "{{k8sDeployName}}"
k8s_deploy_domain = "{{k8sDeployDomain}}"
k8s_namespace     = "{{k8sNamespace}}"
proxy_image_name  = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-integration-proxy:0.1.0"
app_image_name    = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:202303-0.19.5-beta"
```

Note the `license_id`, `organization_id` values can be found by following instructions at the [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#finding-required-ids).

| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| region | Region for PingOne Environment | 
| organization_id | PingOne Organization Id - Located under Environment -> Properties | 
| admin_env_id | PingOne Environment Id for Administrators Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties |
| admin_user_id | User Id for a user in the Administrators Environment - Located under Identities -> Users -> Select user -> Click API tab -> ID |
| license_id | License Id to be used for PingOne Environment |
| worker_id | Client Id for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select existing Worker App or create one -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client ID |
| worker_secret | Client Secret for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select Worker App -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client Secret |
| k8s_deploy_name | Name used for k8s deployment |
| k8s_deploy_domain | K8s Deploy Domain name |
| k8s_namespace | K8s Namespace to deploy app |

### Deployment

In the command line, navigate to the /terraform directory and run:

```zsh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```hcl
terraform apply â€”auto-approve
````

If this is successful, you will see a new environment added to your PingOne organization under the name "Ping Identity Example". 

### Optional
Ping Identity Technical Enablement hosts and maintains the sample for you. If for some reason you'd rather build and host your own Docker images for the sample app, here are the instructions to do that. 

You would need to have your own Docker image repo to push to and update your tfvars file accordingly. Depending on your image repo, whether that's local, ECR, GCR, etc, you may need to update the k8s.tf file too. 

But again, none of this is necessary to use this project.

Note: in this current version, we are not using the fastify proxy server image. So recreating that is unnecessary.

**From the command line**, change directories to the /bxretail-sample-app directory.

`cd <your project path>/BXTerraform/BXTerraform-Sample-Apps/BXRetail-Terraform-pkg/bxretail-sample-app`

Then run, `build -f Dockerfile.dev -t <host>/<repo_path>/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:<version_tag> .`
